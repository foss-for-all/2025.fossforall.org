description: Learn what is FOSS for All Conference.

The first edition of FOSS for All Conference is a non-profit open source community event under the slogan “Free and Open Source Software for All.” Our goal is to create an open source conference for everyone.

Globally, non-profit open source conferences like COSCUP (Taiwan) and FOSDEM (Belgium) are thriving, nurturing their local open source ecosystems. In Korea, large global open source projects such as Python, Golang, Ubuntu, OpenStack, and Kubernetes can organize their own conferences with sponsors, but smaller projects and individuals face challenges in hosting technical exchange events. FOSS for All was launched to help foster the domestic open source ecosystem by bringing together diverse open source projects in Korea.

FOSS for All is open to anyone interested in open source software and communities—developers, contributors, designers, translators, planners, and more. The conference will feature technical talks, community booths, panel discussions, and various programs for sharing experiences and knowledge.

All operations of FOSS for All are made possible by sponsorships, donations, and volunteers. We minimize participation fees so that anyone can join, and maintain an open, voluntary spirit in line with the philosophy of free and open source software.
