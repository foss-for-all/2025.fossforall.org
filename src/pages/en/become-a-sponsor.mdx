description: Join FOSS for All Conference as a Sponsor
---

Thank you for your interest in sponsoring the inaugural FOSS for All Conference! With the slogan and goal of "Open Source Conference for Everyone," this event brings together a diverse range of open source projects and communities from Korea and abroad to share experiences and knowledge, and to regularly foster the growth of the open source ecosystem.

The FOSS for All Conference is organized by a volunteer committee without monetary compensation, and is prepared as a non-profit event. Therefore, the costs required for the event are covered through participation fees and sponsorships. To ensure that as many people as possible can attend without financial burden, we are minimizing the participation fee, making the contribution of sponsors even more crucial for the success of the event.

Your sponsorship will not only help bring together many members of the open source community from Korea and abroad, but also demonstrate genuine support for the open source community. It will also greatly contribute to FOSS for Allâ€™s main mission of "building a sustainable free and open source ecosystem."

Through the sponsorship packages provided, you can strengthen your branding to various open source communities, promote your company or service, interact with participants, and potentially recruit new developers or engineers for your organization.

For more details about the sponsorship program, please refer to the sponsorship tiers and proposal below.
